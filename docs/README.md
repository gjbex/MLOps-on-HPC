Machine learning is becoming increasingly important in many fields, and topics
such as reproducibility, data management, and data visualization are essential
for any machine learning project. This training will teach you how to use MLOps
frameworks to manage your machine learning projects, how to handle data and
workflows.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * be able to use DVC to version your data;
  * be able to define pipelines with DVC;
  * be able to use DVC to manage your machine learning projects;
  * be able to reproduce your machine learning experiments.


## Schedule

Total duration: 4 hours.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/gjbex/MLOps-on-HPC), as well as example code and
hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to manage machine learning workflows on
HPC systems.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience running machine learning workloads in Python or R.  You
will also need to be comfortable on the command line, and have some experience
using the git version control system.
